# Contributing to Digger

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Digger! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project and maintaining consistency with the project's design principles.

## Development Philosophy

Digger is designed to be a cozy mining and collecting game with a focus on:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Touch-friendly controls
- Low-pressure, relaxing gameplay
- Satisfying visual and audio feedback
- Short play sessions (5-10 minutes)

For a detailed overview of the game's design principles, please refer to the [digger-game-guidelines.md](.clinerules/digger-game-guidelines.md) document.

## Code Standards

### Implementation Approach
- Use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Create modular code that separates concerns (game logic, UI, data management)
- Design systems that accommodate future expansion
- Prioritize performance optimization for mobile devices

### Code Organization
- Structure game systems into logical components
- Create clean separation between UI rendering and game state management
- Organize CSS with mobile-first principles
- Use descriptive variable and function names that reflect game terminology
